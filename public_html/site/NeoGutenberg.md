NeoGutenberg, an ebook editor/publisher, is now available. The software is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux and should be a lot user-friendlier than other existing desktop ebook publishing tools.

This app uses markdown for file contents, in the hopes of lowering the barrier of entry to digital publishing; yet allows advanced customizations using SCSS/CSS for advanced users.
