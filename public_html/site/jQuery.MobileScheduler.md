I am happy to announce the release of [jQuery.MobileScheduler](https://github.com/Oproma/jQuery.MobileScheduler). 
After scouring the web searching for a component that would meet our needs and coming back empty handed, I've decided to implement my own and received approval to open-source it. Tested on both iOS and Android through Cordova, the instantiation should be extremely straightforward.

{{#highlight 'javascript'}}
$('#calendar').MobileScheduler();
{{/highlight}}
